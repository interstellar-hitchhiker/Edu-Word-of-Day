# The Daily Lexical Biscuit

A vanilla JavaScript, offline-first word-of-the-day PWA with a 365-word archive, local favourites, archive search, copy-card support, and optional local BBC ambience MP3 files.

This package was refactored from the original single-file HTML prototype. The original is preserved in `legacy/daily-lexical-biscuit-single-file-original.html`.

## Run locally

Because the word archive and audio library are loaded from JSON files, run the app from a local server rather than opening `index.html` directly.

```bash
cd daily-lexical-biscuit-pwa
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## Add the three BBC MP3 files

The generated zip does **not** include the audio files. Put your downloaded MP3s in this exact folder:

```text
assets/audio/bbc/
```

Use these exact filenames:

```text
assets/audio/bbc/bbc_song-thrus_nhu0508018.mp3
assets/audio/bbc/bbc_fire---clo_nhu0500210.mp3
assets/audio/bbc/bbc_rain---hea_nhu0503213.mp3
```

The app displays them with friendly labels:

| App label | Required filename | Source lookup link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Song thrush birdsong | `bbc_song-thrus_nhu0508018.mp3` | https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?q=NHU05080188 |
| Close fire / fireplace | `bbc_fire---clo_nhu0500210.mp3` | https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?q=NHU05002102 |
| Heavy rain | `bbc_rain---hea_nhu0503213.mp3` | https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/search?q=NHU05032133 |

The app reads this mapping from `assets/data/audio-library.json`. Change that file if you later rename the MP3s or add more ambience tracks.

## Audio behaviour

- No sound autoplays.
- Select a soundscape, then press **Play ambience**.
- Changing the selected ambience refreshes the audio source. If audio was already playing, the new selection starts playing after the change.
- The audio loops quietly and uses the app volume slider.
- If a file is missing, the app shows which filename needs to be placed in `assets/audio/bbc/`.

## BBC Sound Effects acknowledgement

The optional ambience filenames and source links are for BBC Sound Effects downloads supplied by the project owner.
